# CommitViewer [JAVA]
Exercise I did as part of the interview process of a company.

# How to run CommitViewer
Simply clone this project and run the CommitViewer.jar file!

# Existing files
* CommitViewer.jar  =>  (This is your runnable file, simply double click it)
* /logs/  =>  (Folder where all your repo command outputs will end up, the name of the file will be "{username}_{repository_name}")
* /error_logs/  =>  (Folder with logs of any error that occurs, the name of the file will be the date and time of the error occurence)

# Instructions
Once you run the .jar file a window that looks like a Console should pop up, after that you can start inputting VALID commands.

# Valid Commands
You have 5 available commands! Here's how each one of them behaves.

Command Input | Behaviour
------------ | -------------
Help | Writes all the available commands and a small explanation for what each of them does!
Clear | Clears the console!
Exit | Closes the console.
Ping | Writes back "Pong!"
Repo | After inputing this command, the console will be waiting for a repository link on the next input.
Cancel | Cancels the wait for a repository link, in case you regret inputting the "repo" command...

# Example on how to run a Repo Command

* ðŸŸ¢  =>  "repo" Command input.
* ðŸ”µ  =>  Copy&Paste or Type in your github repository link.
* ðŸŸ¡  =>  Output.

# Error Handling
If you ever run into an error, you will be able to read this on the Console.
